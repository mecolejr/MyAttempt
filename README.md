# TruePlace

TruePlace helps people decide where they'll feel at home by turning public/open data into clear, explainable location insights and ranked recommendations. It blends safety, affordability, diversity, health, and sustainability signals into a transparent score, with drill-downs and citations so users can verify the source of truth.

## üåü Core Features

### üìç Personalized Recommendations
- Collects user preferences (budget, safety/affordability/diversity weights, etc.)
- Scores candidate places and returns ranked list with factor-by-factor "contribution" breakdowns
- Transparent scoring system with detailed explanations

### üìä Analytics Dashboard
- **Overview tiles**: Safety, Population, Rent, Health and Sustainability scores
- **Detailed tabs**: Crime statistics, Demographics with diversity charts, Housing metrics, Health indicators, Sustainability measures
- **Data sources**: Every section shows sources and timestamps for verification

### üîç Explainability
- Each recommendation shows composite score plus individual contributions (safety, affordability, diversity, mobility, inclusion)
- API responses include `citations` array and "lastUpdated" timestamps
- Full transparency into data sources and calculation methods

## üìä Data Sources & Integration

### üèõÔ∏è U.S. Census Bureau (ACS 5-Year)
- Population, median age, income, poverty rates
- Housing metrics (median rent/value, vacancy, homeownership)
- Race (B02001) and Ethnicity (B03002) distributions
- **Diversity Index**: Simpson's Diversity Index from ACS race distribution
- **FIPS Resolution**: Census Geocoder by address ‚Üí Place GEOID with ACS NAME lookup fallback

### üöî FBI Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR)
- State-level offense totals with graceful fallback for missing keys
- **Safety Score**: Weighted penalty model emphasizing violent crime over property crime
- Mock data integration for development environments

### üè• CDC PLACES (Local Data for Better Health)
- City/place-level health indicators (obesity, diabetes, smoking, mental distress, uninsured)
- **Health Score**: Simple scoring by penalizing high-prevalence indicators

### üåç Environmental Data
- **Air Quality**: OpenAQ API for PM2.5/PM10/O‚ÇÉ measurements
- **Green Space**: OSM Overpass API for park features and density
- **Sustainability Score**: Blends air quality (60%) and greenspace (40%) with log-scaling

### üíæ Caching & Persistence
- TTL-based caching (~12h) with Prisma/SQLite backend
- Government data endpoint returns `citations` and `lastUpdated` timestamps
- Graceful fallbacks for API unavailability

## ‚ö° Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Installation
```bash
# Clone or navigate to project directory
cd trueplace

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up database
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# Copy environment file (optional)
cp .env.example .env
```

### Development
```bash
# Standard development (Turbopack)
npm run dev

# Production-first development (recommended for stability)
npm run dev-prod      # Build + start on port 3001
npm run dev-quick     # Build + start on default port

# Alternative development modes
npm run dev-safe      # Dev on port 3001
npm run dev-alt       # Dev without Turbopack
```

### Production
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port).

## üì± Usage

1. **Navigate to `/trueplace`** - Main application interface
2. **Set Preferences** - Enter budget and weight factors (safety, affordability, diversity, mobility, inclusion)
3. **Get Recommendations** - Receive ranked locations with compatibility scores
4. **View Details** - Click "View Details" on any recommendation for comprehensive analytics
5. **Explore Analytics** - Browse tabs for crime, demographics, housing, health, and sustainability data

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional)
```env
# API Keys
FBI_API_KEY=your_fbi_api_key_here
CENSUS_API_KEY=your_census_api_key_here
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key_here

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret_here
```

### Development Workflow Notes
- **Next.js 15.4.2 + Turbopack**: May have stability issues in development mode
- **Recommended**: Use `npm run dev-prod` for most reliable development experience
- **Production builds**: Provide environment parity and catch issues early
- **Build time**: ~3-5 seconds vs instant HMR tradeoff for stability

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.4.6 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript with React 19
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first design
- **Charts**: Recharts and Chart.js for data visualization
- **Design**: Mobile-first responsive layout

### API Routes (`src/app/api/*`)
- `government-data/route.ts`: Orchestrates fetch ‚Üí compute ‚Üí cache; returns data + citations
- `match/route.ts`: Accepts preferences, enriches locations, scores, returns ranked results
- Additional routes for profiles, locations, chat intake (LLM)

### Services (`src/lib/services/`)
- **governmentData.ts**: Encapsulates all external API integrations
- **Handles**: FIPS resolution, fallbacks, metrics computation, composite scoring
- **Features**: Caching, error handling, graceful degradation

### Hooks & Components
- `useGovernmentData(city,state,type)`: Fetches analytics data per tab

## üîç Scoring System

### Input Processing
- User weights and constraints (budgetMax, factor weights)
- Location enrichment with live government data

### Factor Calculation
- **Safety**: Normalized from Safety Score/100 to [0,1]
- **Diversity**: Simpson's index scaled to [0,1]
- **Affordability**: Inverted normalized rent with budget adjustments
- **Mobility & Inclusion**: Boolean mappings to [0,1]

### Final Scoring
